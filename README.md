# Personal Project - Idea

## Stock portfolio pie charts

Basic goals proposal:
- What will the application do? It takes inputs of stock investment data from a user, and plots pie charts for data visualization and organizing.
- Who will use it? People with a few stocks in their portfolio and want to better visualize them for future decisions.
- Why is this project of interest to you? I have some investment in low-risk funds, and occasionally have need to visualize my portfolio. A lot of stock apps can do similar things and much more, but it is nice to know whether I can get a start at doing such things too.

User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to **input** an arbitrary number of my invested stocks (X) into a list (Y).
- As a user, I want to input data about those items, including: **name**, **invested money**, **price**.
- As a user, I want to be able to **delete** those items.
- As a user, I want to be able to **update** those items, such as: change prices or invested money on it.
- As a user, I need to see a **list** of stocks with their info in each row, or something like that.
- As a user, I want to save inputted stock info items in a file on hard drive.
- As a user, I want to load the file I saved last time.
- *(Stretch goal)* As a user, I may want to see pie charts for 2-3 months juxtaposed together for comparison.
- *(Stretch goal)* As a user, I may want to see an alternate chart of the same month, but with stocks categorized by sectors.
