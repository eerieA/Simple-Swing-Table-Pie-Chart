# Personal Project - Idea 1

## Stock portfolio pie charts

Basic goals proposal:
- What will the application do? It takes inputs of stock investment data from a user, and plots pie charts for data visualization and organizing.
- Who will use it? People with a few stocks in their portfolio and want to better visualize them for future decisions.
- Why is this project of interest to you? I have some investment in low-risk funds, and occasionally have need to visualize my portfolio. A lot of stock apps can do similar things and much more, but it is nice to know whether I can get a start at doing such things too.

User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to **input** an arbitrary number of my invested stocks (X) into a list (Y).
- As a user, I want to input data about those items, including: **name**, **shares**, **worth**.
- As a user, I want to be able to **delete** those items.
- As a user, I want to be able to **update** those items, such as: change shares/worth.
- *(Stretch goal)* As a user, I may want to see pie charts for 2-3 months juxtaposed together for comparison.
- *(Stretch goal)* As a user, I may want to see an alternate chart of the same month, but with stocks categorized by sectors.



# Personal Project - Idea 2

## Person name generator in English

Basic goals proposal:
- What will the application do? Let a user input two initial letters, and then click a button to generate one or multiple human names in English.
- Who will use it? Writers who want to have placeholder names for their short stories.
- Why is this project of interest to you? I found a similar idea in a Git repo listing some starter java project ideas. There is an idea of name generator that involves using RNN, so I was attracted to it. However, I don't think using RNN is very easy for my at this stage. So I simplified that idea down to this one.

User stories:
- As a user, I want to 1-click generate a random English name for a person, using an embedded library of **first name**s and **surname**s.
- As a user, I want to **specify the initial letters**, and don't mind limiting it to two letters.
- As a user, I want to see the generated name in a GUI.
- *(Stretch goal)* As a user, I might want to also specify whether I want the name to sound like **cis female**, **cis male** or **unisex**.
- As a user, I might want to generate an arbitrary number of names (X) and form a list (Y), see all of them in a GUI, so that I can pick one I like the best.
